        <h1>Ninjutsu</h1>
         <ul>
           <li>Rasengan: The Rasengan was created by Minato Namikaze himself, which was based off of the Tailed Beast Bomb. Minato Spent three years developing the the Rasengan, which he intended to be the highest shape form of shape transformation, a sphere. The Rasengan requires no hand signs and does not take any more chakra to sustain it once it is formed, meaning there is no limit to how long one can stay formed, unless it collides with something, in which it dissapates. A basic Rasengan is just a sphere of chakra, but it can be added on to. Some variations of the rasengan are the Rasenshuriken, created by the 7th Hokage and Minato's son, Naruto Uzumaki, as well as the Vanishing Rasengan, created by Minato's grandson, Boruto Uzumaki. You can learn more about the Rasengan <a href = "https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Rasengan#:~:text=Overview,highest%20form%20of%20shape%20transformation.&text=Like%20many%20of%20Minato's%20jutsu,require%20hand%20seals%20to%20perform." target = "_blank">here</a>.</li><br>
           <li>Space-Time Ninjutsu: Minato's other signature ability was the Flying Thunder God Technique, which he gained greater mastery and versatility than its creator, the Second Hokage. His exploits with this technique gained him the moniker "Konoha's Yellow Flash". Using the technique, he could instantly move to the location of anything marked with his special seal, whether a tool, place, or person that was branded. Minato could bring others with him, though he needed to provide the chakra for their transport. He did not need to accompany targets he teleported, giving him a defensive option to teleport incoming projectiles away.

           <li>Fūinjutsu: Minato learned several fūinjutsu from Jiraiya and Kushina. The most notable of these was the Eight Trigrams Sealing Style he used to seal the Nine-Tails' Yang-half into Naruto, which would allow small amounts of the Nine-Tails' chakra to naturally mix with Naruto's own. Knowing the seal would slowly weaken over time, Minato created a key that could accelerate or reverse this process. As an extra precaution, he mixed Kushina's and his own chakra into the seal so that, when certain conditions were met, they could help Naruto with his control of the Nine-Tails' power, as well as allow them to see their son after they were dead. Minato could also perform the Dead Demon Consuming Seal, which he had enough familiarity with to know it couldn't be used to seal all of the Nine-Tails' chakra. With the Contract Seal, he could remove an opponent's control over any creatures they summoned. He also knew how to immediately transfer a tailed beast from one jinchūriki to another.

        <h1>Early Life</h1>
         <p>Minato entered Konoha's Academy with the dream of earning the villagers' respect and recognition by becoming Hokage. When Kushina Uzumaki moved to Konoha, she was placed in the same class as Minato. Minato was immediately drawn to her bright red hair, finding it beautiful. Minato was a natural prodigy as a ninja, the likes of which appears only once in a generation. When he was added to a genin team under the leadership of Jiraiya, Jiraiya took a special interest in Minato and took him on as his apprentice, teaching him many of his own signature abilities. In time, Minato's exceptional skills led Jiraiya to believe he might be the Child of the Prophecy, someone who would someday save the world.</p>
         <p>Years later, after they graduated and became ninja, Kushina was kidnapped by Kumogakure forces. Konoha mobilised its ninja to retrieve her, but only Minato noticed the strands of red hair Kushina left behind to mark their path. Minato, acting alone, rescued her from her captors. On their way back to Konoha, Minato confessed his admiration for her hair and her strength, causing Kushina – who had previously believed Minato "unreliable" and even "girly" – to fall in love with him.</p>
        <h1>Reign as Hokage</h1>
         <p>For his performance during the War, Minato was chosen over Orochimaru to become Fourth Hokage. He taught the Flying Thunder God Technique to the Hokage Guard Platoon to better aid them in their duties of serving the Hokage at any given time. In the anime, he also tried to help Kakashi, now an Anbu, emerge from the darkness he'd fallen into after Obito and Rin's deaths. During the gradual transfer of responsibilities from the Third Hokage to him, the Third advised Minato to restore Kakashi's value of life by tasking him with protecting Kushina</p>
        <h1>Personality</h1>
         <p>Despite his physical resemblance to Naruto, Minato was a very humble and collected man. Very perceptive and shrewd, he was noted as not to do something without a reason. He was well-aware of the terror his reputation inspired in rival villages and would take advantage of it at times, but even then he would remain respectful to opponents. Minato also wouldn't pry into other people's personal affairs unless he felt it was necessary, and was not the type to hold grudges, only feeling sorry for Obito despite his role in his own and Kushina's deaths. If anything, Minato blames himself for his death for several reasons; he couldn't save Obito from the fate that corrupted him, Konoha from the difficulties that arose after he was gone, and even his own son Naruto from the painful and difficult life he suffered as a jinchūriki orphan.</p>
         <h1>Appearance</h1>
         <p>Minato has frequently been compared with Naruto in terms of physical appearance; both have blue eyes and spiky, blond hair. Minato also had jaw-length bangs framing either side of his face. According to Jiraiya, Minato was considered to be very handsome. His normal attire consisted of a standard Konoha uniform with two bands on both of his sleeves, a green flak jacket, blue forehead protector, and blue sandals. After becoming Hokage, he started wearing a short-sleeved long white haori over his normal attire, closed in the front by a thin, orange rope. The haori was decorated by red flame-like motifs on the edges, with the kanji for "Fourth Hokage" (四代目火影, Yondaime Hokage) written vertically down the back.</p>
